                <strong>Note on Gender and Research:</strong> Much of the research on ADHD has historically focused on individuals 
                assigned male at birth, leading to an understanding of symptoms that may not fully capture the experiences of those 
                assigned female at birth or those who identify as women and girls. While this section uses the terms "girls" and "women" 
                based on the language used in clinical research, we acknowledge that gender exists on a spectrum and that ADHD affects 
                people of all gender identities. The symptom patterns described here are relevant to anyone assigned female at birth and 
                may also resonate with individuals across the gender spectrum.

            <p className="mb-6">
              ADHD in individuals assigned female at birth is significantly underdiagnosed and undertreated. Research 
              suggests that girls and women with ADHD often present differently than boys and men, leading to missed or delayed 
              diagnoses. The inattentive presentation is more common in females, and symptoms may be less externally 
              disruptive, causing them to be overlooked.
