              Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) is an intense emotional response to perceived or actual rejection, criticism, 
              or failure. RSD is largely a clinically-defined concept rather than one heavily studied in peer-reviewed, 
              double-blind trials. However, several studies, clinical case series, and qualitative research papers explore 
              its mechanisms, particularly in relation to ADHD. While not an official DSM-5-TR diagnosis<sup style={{color: '#10b981'}}>[1]</sup>, RSD is a commonly 
              reported experience among individuals with ADHD. It involves extreme emotional pain triggered by the perception 
              that one has been rejected, teased, or criticized by important people in their life, or that they have failed 
              to meet their own high standards or others' expectations.

                  <div className="text-sm pl-4">Research suggests that for those with ADHD, the brain processes rejection differently, 
                  creating a "hyperalert" state to social rejection. RSD is related to differences in emotional regulation in ADHD brains. 
                  The same executive function deficits that affect attention and impulse control also impact emotional control. 
                  People with ADHD may experience all emotions more intensely, and negative emotions related to perceived rejection 
                  can be particularly overwhelming.</div>

                  <div className="text-sm pl-4">Many people with ADHD have experienced years of criticism, correction, and negative 
                  feedback about ADHD-related behaviors (being "too much," "not trying hard enough," "careless," "irresponsible"). 
                  This history can create a heightened sensitivity to any perceived criticism or rejection.</div>

                  <div className="font-bold text-[#0c264d] mb-2">Perfectionism and Compensation:</div>
                  <div className="text-sm pl-4">Many people with ADHD develop perfectionist tendencies as a way to compensate for 
                  their difficulties and avoid criticism. This makes any perceived failure particularly painful.</div>

                and researchers as a significant aspect of the ADHD experience. If RSD is severely impacting your quality of 
                life, discuss it with your healthcare provider. Treatment for ADHD (medication and therapy) can help reduce 
                RSD symptoms.
